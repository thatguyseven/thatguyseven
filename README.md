Hi, Iâ€™m Aaron Ni, a junior studying Computer Science at Norfolk State University. 
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new experiences and new ideas. I love learning from new perspectives and seeing the same problem in a different light.   

Iâ€™m currently learning about open source projects.
You can reach me at my email aaronni0718@gmail.com.
